# Hotline-Python
A Hotline Miami-like game written in python with pygame

Hotline-Python is a top-down 2d shooter, similar to Hotline Miami. It is currently in very early stages and most animations, sounds etc. are placeholders.

I work on it during my free time and I do it just for fun.

To run the program pygame is required, as well as Python 3
